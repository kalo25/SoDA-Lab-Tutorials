# Lecture 9 script: Spatial Data, GIS, and Remote Sensing

## Slide 1 — Title

In this lecture we’ll cover spatial data, GIS workflows, and remote sensing.

The big idea is that space is not just a background coordinate. In a lot of social science, location is part of the measurement process. Where something happens—relative to borders, roads, cities, hazards, and institutions—often matters for explanation, and it also shapes what is observed.

So today I’ll focus on the core building blocks: what spatial data are, vector versus raster formats, spatial joins, coordinate reference systems, and remote sensing. And I’ll emphasize a recurring theme: spatial analysis is highly sensitive to preprocessing and representation choices—especially CRS, aggregation boundaries, and resolution.

## Slide 2 — Why space matters

Many social processes vary across space: economic development, conflict and violence, urbanization, environmental exposure.

The key line is: spatial structure is not noise.

A lot of models assume errors are independent or that geography is just a control. But if the process you’re studying is spatially clustered—because of diffusion, shared environments, infrastructure, or strategic interaction—then location is a core part of the data-generating process.

Even if your outcome isn’t “spatial” in a conceptual sense, measurement often is. For example: reporting and observation are spatially uneven. Some areas have more administrative capacity, more journalism, more sensors, or more connectivity. So what you observe is partly a function of where you’re looking.

So in spatial data work, we repeatedly separate two questions:

* Where does the underlying process vary spatially?
* Where does measurement vary spatially?

---

## Slide 3 — What is spatial data

Spatial data link observations to location: points, lines, polygons, and rasters.

Points can be event locations, addresses, facility coordinates.
Lines can be roads, borders, migration flows, river networks.
Polygons can be administrative units, neighborhoods, districts, countries.
Rasters are gridded surfaces—think satellite imagery, temperature, vegetation.

And the key line is: location is part of the measurement.

That matters because you’re not just attaching coordinates. You’re making choices about what the location represents: where an event occurred, where an organization is headquartered, where a population is aggregated, or where a sensor recorded something. Those are not always the same thing.

---

## Slide 4 — Vector vs raster data

Two core spatial types: vector data and raster data.

Vector data represent discrete objects—points, lines, polygons. They’re great when the world is best represented as objects with boundaries: districts, roads, parcels.

Raster data represent continuous surfaces—grids. They’re great when measurement is continuous or remotely sensed: land cover, night lights, cloud cover, temperature, elevation, image pixels.

And the key line here is: each supports different kinds of questions.

In practice, a lot of workflows combine them. For example, you might take raster-derived variables—like vegetation or night lights—and aggregate them into polygon units like districts. Or you might take point events—like protests—and assign them to polygons like counties.

So vector and raster are not competing. They’re complementary.

---

## Slide 5 — Spatial joins

Spatial joins combine data using geometry: point-in-polygon, distance-based joins, overlap and containment.

And the key line is crucial: joins encode spatial assumptions.

A point-in-polygon join assumes that the point belongs to the polygon that contains it. That is often right, but it can fail near borders, with inaccurate coordinates, or when the polygon boundary isn’t the relevant social boundary.

Distance-based joins assume proximity captures exposure or influence. That can be reasonable, but it depends on what distance means—Euclidean distance, travel distance, or network distance.

Overlap and containment matter for polygon intersections—like how much of a district overlaps a flood zone.

So, in spatial data, joins are not just merging. They are measurement rules for how space implies membership or exposure.

---

## Slide 6 — Coordinate reference systems (CRS)

CRS is where many spatial analyses quietly break.

CRS define how locations map to the Earth, the units of distance and area, and projection distortions.

The key warning: CRS mismatches silently break analyses.

If you calculate distance in a geographic CRS—latitude/longitude—you can get nonsense units. If you overlay layers with different CRS, intersections can fail or produce incorrect results. If you compute area without a projection appropriate for your region, you can distort magnitude.

So the basic workflow rule is: before doing geometry operations—joins, buffers, distances—make sure everything is in a consistent CRS, and verify the units.

**[pause]**

This is also an example of a course theme: software will often let you do the wrong thing without yelling. Spatial workflows demand habits that prevent silent failure.

---

## Slide 7 — Reading spatial data (Python)

This slide shows a basic Python pattern: using GeoPandas to read a spatial file.

The details aren’t the point. The point is that spatial data are typically stored in formats like shapefiles, GeoJSON, GeoPackage, or similar. Reading them yields a geodataframe where geometry is a first-class column.

A good habit is to inspect:

* the geometry type,
* the CRS,
* and the attribute fields.

Because geometry plus attributes is the full dataset.

---

## Slide 8 — Reading spatial data (R)

Same pattern in R, using `sf`.

Again: load the data, inspect the CRS, inspect geometry types.

This is the “trust but verify” moment. The data object tells you what it thinks it is. You should confirm that matches what you think it is.

---

## Slide 9 — Reprojection

Reprojection is the core preprocessing step in many spatial pipelines.

Before analysis: ensure a common CRS, reproject explicitly, and verify units.

The code snippets show how you would do that in Python and R.

But the conceptual point is: projection is a measurement choice.

Different projections preserve different properties. Some preserve area, some preserve shape, some preserve distances locally, some preserve directions. In social science, area and distance are common operations, so you choose projections accordingly.

So: don’t treat CRS as a nuisance. Treat it as part of the measurement design.

---

## Slide 10 — Mapping is not analysis

This slide is a warning and a principle.

Maps are descriptive, persuasive, and sensitive to design choices. Visualizations can mislead.

Even if your underlying data are correct, the map can mislead through color scales, classification choices, smoothing, or aggregation.

So the best habit is to think of maps as a communication tool, not an inferential tool. You can map patterns, but you should not infer causality from a map.

And when you use maps in research, you should be explicit about the choices: what is being shown, at what resolution, with what classification, and what is being left out.

---

## Slide 11 — Basic spatial features

Common spatial features include distances, buffers, neighborhood counts, and exposure measures.

Feature choice shapes inference.

This is a big theme. In a lot of spatial analysis, you reduce geometry to features that can enter models. How you do that reduction is a measurement decision.

For example: “distance to nearest hospital” is a feature. But how do you define distance—straight-line or travel time? “Exposure to pollution” is a feature. But how do you aggregate pollution within a buffer? “Neighborhood violence” is a feature. But what radius defines “neighborhood”?

So when we build spatial features, we are constructing concepts out of geometry.

---

## Slide 12 — Distance example (conceptual)

This slide shows a simple distance calculation.

The caution is that distance calculations only make sense if the CRS units are meaningful—typically meters in a projected CRS. If you compute distance in degrees, you are not getting an interpretable distance measure.

Also, distance is not always what matters. Sometimes travel time matters more. Sometimes network distance matters more. But as a basic feature, distance is often the first spatial variable people compute.

So the deeper message is: distances are easy to compute; it’s harder to justify what “distance” means for your concept.

---

## Slide 13 — Raster data and remote sensing

Now we shift to rasters and remote sensing.

Raster data represent satellite imagery, climate surfaces, land use and cover. They enable consistent global measurement.

This is why remote sensing is so powerful for social science: it gives you measurement that is not dependent on administrative capacity or reporting infrastructure in the same way as surveys or newspapers.

But it’s not bias-free. It has its own measurement constraints and missingness patterns.

So the mindset is: remote sensing changes which parts of the world are measurable, but it also changes what the measurement errors look like.

---

## Slide 14 — Working with rasters

This slide just names the basic tooling: rasterio in Python, terra in R.

The conceptual point is: raster resolution trades detail for coverage.

High-resolution imagery is detailed but expensive to store and process. Lower-resolution products are easier to work with but can miss local variation. Temporal resolution matters too—how frequently measurements are updated.

So in remote sensing workflows, you constantly choose resolution in space and time, and those choices shape what you can learn.

---

## Slide 15 — Measurement and bias

This slide is the conceptual anchor for spatial validity threats.

Spatial data raise issues like the modifiable areal unit problem—MAUP—boundary definitions, cloud cover and missingness, and strategic behavior.

Let me unpack those quickly.

MAUP: when you aggregate point or raster data to polygons, results can change depending on how the polygons are defined. Counties vs tracts vs districts can yield different relationships.

Boundary definitions: administrative boundaries are political artifacts. They often don’t match lived social boundaries. Using them is sometimes necessary, but it’s not neutral.

Cloud cover and missingness: remote sensing can be systematically missing in certain seasons, regions, or climate zones. If that missingness correlates with the outcome—like deforestation or conflict monitoring—you can get bias.

Strategic behavior: once actors know they are being monitored, they may adapt. They may time actions to avoid observation or exploit detection limits.

So the key line is right: space interacts with incentives. Measurement is not passive.

---

## Slide 16 — Scalability considerations

Spatial analysis can be expensive.

Geometry operations are slow, rasters are large, and indexing matters.

So efficiency is part of design.

This is another example of course-wide themes: scalability and reproducibility are intertwined. If a pipeline is too slow, people start doing manual workarounds—partial runs, exports, untracked subsets—and reproducibility deteriorates.

So we want workflows that are computationally feasible and scripted. Spatial indexing, careful data types, and sensible resolution choices are not just performance issues; they’re what keep pipelines stable.

---

## Slide 17 — Documentation and reproducibility

Spatial workflows should record data sources, CRS choices, join logic, and resolution and aggregation decisions.

And the key line: spatial results are sensitive to preprocessing.

This is perhaps more true in spatial workflows than in many other domains. Small differences in CRS, boundary definitions, or join logic can produce big differences in outputs.

So documentation isn’t optional. If someone else can’t reconstruct your CRS choices, your joins, and your aggregation rules, they can’t reproduce your spatial results.

And this also matters for you. Spatial pipelines are the kind of thing you revisit a year later and can’t remember why you used a certain projection. Document it now.

---

## Slide 18 — What we emphasize in practice

Let me summarize.

Treat location as measurement. Always ask what the location represents.

Inspect geometry explicitly. Don’t assume geometries are valid or aligned.

Be explicit about CRS. Reproject intentionally and verify units.

Validate spatial assumptions. Check sensitivity to boundaries and aggregation, and sanity-check outputs with maps and summary statistics.

That’s the practice set we want you to take away.

---

## Slide 19 — Discussion

Let me close with the discussion questions.

Where does spatial aggregation matter most in your work? What concepts are you turning into polygons or buffers?

Which CRS choices feel consequential? When are you measuring distances or areas, and what projection is appropriate?

And how does space interact with incentives? Where might observation or measurement itself change behavior—especially in remote sensing contexts?
