##CONCEPTUAL QUESTION

1. Explain what problem renv solves in reproducible research. In your answer, describe what information is stored in renv.lock, what renv::restore() does, and why sharing code without dependency versions can fail replication even when the analysis is "correct." 

Reproducibility requires that anyone can obtain the same results as the original research project, using the same dataset(s) and code, without guidance from the original researcher. One reason reproducibility can be difficult is because versions of coding terminals like RStudio frequently update, and every researcher may have a different version of a terminal on their own device depending on their preferences. The renv package addresses this issue by giving researchers a way to copy and preserve their work environment for a specific project; i.e., renv records the packages (in the specific versions) used for the project and what exists in the library. renv.lock is a "lockfile" that records all information about the R version, the various repositories packages were downloaded from, the version of packages installed, etc. so that it can be recreated by anyone. Anyone who wishes to reproduce a specific project can then download the renv file folder and run renv::restore(), which then recreates the exact workplace environment the original researcher was using for their project. Sharing code without dependency versions means you have failed to meet replicability requirements because other researchers have no way of knowing what the correct packages or version are for your project. Just because one person managed to produce an identical analysis and outputs on their device doesn't mean another person will be able to. You need to ensure consistency and foolproof replicability for your entire audience, regardless of how updated their workspaces are.
